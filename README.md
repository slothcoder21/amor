# Purpose:

Going off to college can be hard not only on us, but our parents. Our app aims to keep that flame burning and add little interactions with your parents throughout the day! Sending a Using React native, user research from parents, and an intuitive UI, we hope to help keep that connection with your old folks. Once everyday, a time sensitive notification will pop up with a unique prompt. Each prompt will require one of three different forms of communication, texting, voice memo, or image.
